# Tradingview_Indicator
A Trading View indicator that combines several other indicators

This program combines the 50/100/200 simple moving averages (SMA) and 3/8 exponential moving averages (EMA) along with a volume weighted average price (VWAP) into one script. Furthermore, it provides information about the volume of a given bar by displaying it as white if it is a green candle that has a volume > 50 SMA or yellow if it is the same for a red candle. 

I made this program to streamline my personal trading and research since I wanted only the SMAs on the daily charts and the EMAs and VWAP on the minute charts all while taking up one indicator slot.
